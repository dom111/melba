# 0.2.0

Ditch webpack in favour of using `babel` directly.

Minor styling changes.


# 0.1.0

Initial version - using webpack to package and compress.

Contains minimal accessibility focus, more to to (and validate here).

Focus on being small and having reasonably useful styles for my immediate need.
